First steps 6: Combining plots
==============================

In the :ref:`previous first steps guides <first_steps_5>`, you created
individual plots.

In this section, you will combine several plots into layouts of rows and
columns.

Creating rows and columns
-------------------------

The easiest way to combine individual plots is to assign them to rows or 
columns.

For example:

.. bokeh-plot:: docs/first_steps/examples/first_steps_6_row_layout.py
    :source-position: none

seemore: columns, instead of rows, link to user guide, etc.
